summary: "Nebu and Ulys are back, discussing Big Grease Vaseline. The supposed inventor of Vaseline stole it from poor workers in Pennsylvania and more importantly Native Americans have used some variations of the magical petroleum jelly before that. Anyway, why did Canadians insert random bottles in their rectums... we investigate."

    Nebu & Ulys discuss Ulys's cult #TopoLife by Topo Chico. Before the Cavity Giant Coca Cola bought Topo Chico, they got in hot water for having too many radioactive beta particles in their "mineral" water. Was Ulys having a hard time reading plain words because of #BetaHigh? Nebu wants to join the cult, proclaiming "I just like the drink," insisting on taking Topo Chico to the moon with diamond hands, but only if they disavow the Cavity Giant (which may bring them a bigger class action lawsuit for those extra beta particles anyway). -->
